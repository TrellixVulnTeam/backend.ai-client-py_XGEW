Storage Management
==================

.. note::

   Please consult the detailed usage in the help of each command
   (use ``-h`` or ``--help`` argument to display the manual).

Backend.AI abstracts shared network storages into per-user slices
called "virtual folders", which can be shared between users and user group members.


Running sessions with storages
------------------------------

The following command creates a virtual folder named "mydata1", and then
uploads ``./bigdata.csv`` file into it.

.. code-block:: shell

  backend.ai vfolder create mydata1
  backend.ai vfolder upload mydata1 ./bigdata.csv

The following command spawns a Python session where the virtual folder "mydata1"
is mounted.  The execution options are omitted in this example.
Then, it downloads ``./bigresult.txt`` file (generated by your code) from the
"mydata1" virtual folder.

.. code-block:: shell

  backend.ai run --rm -m mydata1 python:3.6-ubuntu18.04 ...
  backend.ai vfolder download mydata1 ./bigresult.txt

In your code, you may access the virtual folder via ``/home/work/mydata1``
(where the default current working directory is ``/home/work``) just like
a normal directory.
